The CLIENT represents that ADVISOR has been furnished true and complete copies of all applicable plan and trust documents establishing and governing the plan and evidencing the CLIENT’s authority to retain ADVISOR. The person signing this Agreement on behalf of the CLIENT also acknowledges its status as a “named fiduciary” (as defined in ERISA and the Code, respectively) with respect to the control and management of the assets held in the CLIENT’s Account, and agrees to notify ADVISOR promptly of any change in the identity of the named fiduciary with respect to the Account. The CLIENT acknowledges that it will promptly provide ADVISOR with amendments made to plan and/or trust documents. If the CLIENT’s assets are part of a plan subject to ERISA and because ADVISOR is given trading discretion in respect of such assets pursuant to this Agreement, the CLIENT appoints ADVISOR, and ADVISOR accepts such appointment, as an “investment manager” with respect to such assets for purposes of ERISA and the Code; and in connection therewith, ADVISOR acknowledges that it is a “fiduciary” within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA and Section 4957(e)(3) of the Code, and agrees to act with that degree of care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances that a prudent person acting in similar circumstances would use. If the assets in the CLIENT’s Account represent only a portion of an employee benefit plan’s assets, the CLIENT understands that ADVISOR will have no responsibility for the overall compliance and diversification of the plan’s assets, and that ADVISOR will have no duty, responsibility or liability for the portion of the plan's assets that are not covered by this Agreement. If this Section 12 is applicable to all or some of the assets in the CLIENT’s Account, the CLIENT agrees to obtain and maintain a bond, which satisfies the requirements of Section 412 of ERISA, and to include Advisor and its agents among those insured under the bond, and related laws and regulations.</span>
